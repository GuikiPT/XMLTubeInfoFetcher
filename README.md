## About
Some of you may be asking why this simple project is using an inappropriate YouTube API.

YouTube's current API sucks for me in these ways:
* First, the API need a `API Key`.
* Secound, there's a lot of [`Limits`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/quota_and_compliance_audits) to make requests to their API.
* Third, `Rate Limits` are ***Crazy***.
* Fourth, I need a `very basic API Wrapper`, just for `fetch basic information`, I already tryed the oficial wrappers on, but it's very stressful having to create an API Key for such a small project.
* Fifth, I started these project for an Discord Youtube Notification's Bot. If i use current v3 of YouTube API, I will spam and get `Rated Limited` every time for checking if there's a new video from a YouTube Channel. I tryed these a long time ago and I just forfeit. I watch a lot of popular Discord Bots getting rated limited by youtube and yeah.....

## How can I use it?
Like i sayed before, it's pretty simple to use it.

1. Download the project be:
    1. ```git clone https://github.com/GuikiPT/XMLTubeInfoFetcher.git``` if you have git installed.

    2. Or clicking on `<> Code` and after in `Download Zip`.
    > **If you download as zip, you need to uncompress the file!**.

2. Open the folder of the project.

3. Make sure you have Node.JS installed, and if not, install it: [NodeJS Download Website Page](https://nodejs.org/en-us/download).

4. Inside the project folder, open a terminal (*Bash for Linux* and *CMD or PowerShell for Windows*, don't ask me for MacOs, because I not have one to test, but if you want to give me one I really appreciate ðŸ˜Š)

5. Install necessary modules be doing `npm install`. 

6. On the [main.js](main.js) edit the `const channel_id = '';` with the desired YouTube Channel Id.

7. Simply execute the project be doing `npm start` or `npm main.js`;

8. They will retrieve an console log with information about the channel and latest videos:
